_Independent Consultant_

I assisted a small team at Switchboard Victoria, Victoria’s peak body for LGBTQIA+ mental health and suicide prevention, in launching <a href = "http://www.charlee.org.au">CHARLEE</a> – a one-stop website for community resources that advocate for and assist LGBTQIA+ people and their friends and family who have been bereaved by suicide. They led community consultancy sessions and anonymised data from the Coroner’s Inquest into LGBTQIA+ Suicide to develop lived-experienced based resources for friends, families, and allies of LGBTQIA+ people.
