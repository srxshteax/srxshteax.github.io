_Disabilities Officer, University of Melbourne Students Union_

During COVID-19 induced lockdowns, as the Disabilities Officer of the University of Melbourne Students Union, I assisted in extending Special Consideration Examination policies to students struggling with illness and disability, as well as students stuck overseas. I also led the team to solidify WAMnesty â€“ a marksheet amnesty that allowed students to choose to have their scores unaffected by pandemic-induced difficulties.
