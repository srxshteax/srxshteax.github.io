_Women's Officer, University of Melbourne Students Union_

As the Women’s Officer at the Students’ Union, I led the union campaign to deliver the University of Melbourne’s first standalone sexual misconduct policy. This involved liaising with legal stakeholders and corporate consulting groups, as well as running anonymised community consultations with survivors of sexual assault and harassment – especially intersectionally marginalised groups such as immigrants and refugees, LGBTQIA+ people, and disabled people.
