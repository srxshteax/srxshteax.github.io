_Independent Consultant_

Alongside the Youth Affairs Council of Victoria (YACVic), and Children and Young People with Disabilities Australia (CYDA), I have sat on panels and organised focus groups of young people with disabilities and chronic illness to co-design and write grants and policy solutions to unique issues experienced by vulnerable children and young people impacted by COVID-19.
