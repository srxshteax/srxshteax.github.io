As Parliamentary Policy Adviser to Senator Janet Rice, I led portfolio responses to diasporic communities in Victoria, as well as drafted political and media responses to Australian Foreign Policy matters – such as the war in Ukraine, the fall of Kabul, and bombings in Palestine. <br>

During the Parliamentary Enquiry into the Religious Discrimination Bill (2021-2022), I liaised with a diverse range of community members living across different intersections of identity, to prepare them as witnesses, as well as prepare the written Dissenting Report to the Bill. The Report had a comprehensive, intersectional analysis of the experiences of marginalised people and their concerns regarding the bill – such as women, LGBTQIA+ people, First Nations people, people of faith, and disabled people. <br>

I also analysed the Parliamentary Budget, and wrote the Australian Greens 2022 Election Platform’s sections on Multicultural Projects, LGBTQIA+ rights, and Survivors’ Justice.
