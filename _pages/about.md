<div align="justify"> 
  I am a writer, community organiser and political communications strategist based in <a href = "https://auspost.com.au/community-hub/traditional-place-names/naarm-introducing-traditional-place-name-of-melbourne">Naarm</a> [Melbourne] in ‘Australia.’ I’m also an avid reader, teacher, chosen parent, daughter, partner, family and friend – mostly found cooking, reading, and chasing deadlines. <br><br> 
  I completed an Honours degree in Communications from the School of Culture and Communications, the University of Melbourne – where I explored through comparative literary analysis and critical theory, a study of visual communications produced and disseminated as acts of revolutionary praxis. My research into visual media and data presentation has been adapted into grassroots organising toolkits and policy campaigns in ‘Australia’, most notably in the <a href = "https://www.movebeyondcoal.com/solution">Move Beyond Coal</a> campaign and by School Strike for Climate Australia – supporting and training diverse communities to organise people-powered solutions to phase out coal and gas mines in ‘Australia’ by 2030. <br><br>
  I have been a Create Change Fellow with Democracy in Colour, advocating for economic and political justice for people of colour in ‘Australia.’ I currently serve on the Advisory Board for Democracy in Colour’s <a href="https://democracyincolour.org/migration-with-dignity/">Migration With Dignity Campaign</a> – helping immigrants write parliamentary submissions for policies that impact us. I was also a Climate Justice Fellow at Friends of the Earth Australia – where I worked on helping young people on the frontlines of the climate crisis learn data presentation and storytelling skills to advocate for their communities. <br><br>
I have also been a staunch advocate for LGBTQIA+ rights, building multicultural and mutlifaith solidarity in fighting for the rights of queer and trans people to self-identify, access healthcare, and have better outcomes in our mental wellbeing and suicide prevention. For my advocacy for <a href = "https://www.charlee.org.au/">LGBTQIA+ people struggling with suicide</a> and <a href = "https://policy.unimelb.edu.au/MPF1359/">restorative justice for victim-survivors of sexual assault</a>, I was on <a href = "https://www.outforaustralia.org/30-under-30-2021">Out For Australia’s 30 Under 30 List in 2021</a>, and was awarded Community Changemaker of the Year. <br><br>
For fun, I deliver public lectures and keynotes across national conferences, and teach young people how to use data presentation and storytelling to build narratives for intersectional justice. For sheer, absolute queer joy, I read erotic/anti-capitalist poetry, <a href = "https://emergingwritersfestival.org.au/event/dinner-party-press-short-smut/">commenting on libidinal economies and the exploitation of bodies to the fellswoop of desire</a>. I can also nurse most plants back to life, and cook a mean biryani. <br><br>
